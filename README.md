Stock Sim is a stock simulator that is connected to a live price feed of a simulated share of Button!  Users can purchase shares of the stock with their virtual wallet and trade for big gains!

My greatest strengths are learning technologies quickly, building components in React and managing state, and working collaboratively as well taking control of a project with little supervision.  I would like to improve my ability to write complex SQL queries and management of databases.  My ideal intern project would be building a new feature on both the front and back-end that would ultimately be a valuable contribution to the product and team.

Button has a great product that both enhances the experience of the user through it's integrated ads, as well as increasing the revenue potential for the app. It's a win-win model, and would be exciting to me to work on a product that I truly want to succeed.
